    "# Notebook 2: Doing Things with Code  \n",
    "## Input and Control Stuctures\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first Continuous Assessment Notebook we covered some of the basics of Python syntax, as well as assignment, types and the print function. This time we'll be focusing on some basic control structures that allow us to split our code up into chunks. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can think of what we did last time as printing things out, assigning values to variables, and then adding things to our variables. This week we'll write code that will *do different things depending on those variables*.\n",
    "\n",
    "## This Notebook's Aims\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this Notebook, you should be able to do the following.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Assign a variable.\n",
    "* Use the `input()` function.\n",
    "* Use the following types: `bool`, `int`, `str`, `float` and `None` and cast between them.\n",
    "* Write your own function to `return` a value.\n",
    "* Test for equality, inequality and identity.\n",
    "* Employ the `if`/`elif`/`else` syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "### WARNING! Don't start this week's assessment at the last minute!\n",
    "\n",
    "This week's exercise, and next week's are probably the most comprehensive in terms of the amount of new material we cover. Learning to code is like learning a new language (and, indeed, you are learning a new language – it's called Python). In order to be fairly fluent and able to analyse data properly and conduct research by the end of the course, we need to cover lots of what you might consider vocabulary and grammar now. \n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to learn this in order to make the rest of the course easier, and whilst the exercises might be long, it's aimed at being comprehensive and fairly easy to understand with decent examples. There are also lots of challenges - make sure you do these and properly apply yourself to them as 'struggling' with this kind of thing is by far the best way to get to grips with it and make it like second nature!\n",
    "\n",
    "Likewise, **do ask for help - we're here to help you**. While we won't give you the answers to the exercises, we will guide you towards the solutions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "However, we do ask that you **start the exercise nice and early**. You will most likely need some time to go through all this (and, often, search to find material to help you if you're stuck), so starting it at the last minute is a bad idea!\n",

    "There are three **casting functions** which we use to take a value of any type, and try and covert it into the type we want. We say that the function *tries* to convert the values because not every value can be converted to every other: for example, it's easy to see how the string `\"100\"` can be converted to the integer `100`, or the float `100.0`, or how the integer `123` can be converted to the string `\"123\"`, but how would you convert the string `\"woof\"` into an integer? Hint - you can't.\n",

    "\n",
    "*She never came home.*\n",
    "\n",
    "# 😂\n",
    "\n",
    "Hilarious, right? Hmmm. **Let's go through why these jokes are funny (to programmers).**\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these jokes relies on misunderstandings arising out of subtle ambiguities in human language – specifically, the way we split up these sentences. The point of the jokes are how a computer (or, in this case the programmer) and a human being would split up these sentences differently.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first joke, we'd assume the programmer's partner wants him to bring back six eggs and a loaf of bread (or, if there are no eggs, just the loaf of bread). But since the partner doesn't say to buy eggs, only to buy bread, a computer would interpret it the instruction as *Go to the shop. If the shop has eggs, buy six loaves of bread; if the shop does not have eggs, buy one loaf of bread*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second joke relies on a similar misunderstanding. As people, we'd assume that the programmer should pick up milk once whilst she is out, and return with the milk and the dry cleaning. A computer would interpret that as: *go out to collect dry cleaning; whenever you are outside, pick up milk*, based on this interpretation, the programmer never comes home because she is always outside, and so is always picking up more and more milk. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first joke relies on a misunderstanding of the word `if`, and the second joke relies on misunderstanding the word `while`. Both these words are important **keywords** in python. They are **control structures** which allow us to control which bits of our code run, and how many times they run. We'll learn to use both this week.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this though, we have to split up our code into **blocks**, and in Python, we do this through **indentation**. i.e., putting **tabs** before our code. On most keyboards, the tab key is towards the top left, and looks soemthing like this `⇥`.\n",

    "That code is great, but we can improve it. Let's imagine that somehow the programmer's brain was linked to the shop's stock management software. Now, it's very unlikely that the shop would simply have a boolean variable called `shop_has_eggs`. What use would that be to anyone other than joke writers? \n",
    "\n",
    "It would be much more probable that there was a variable called something like `egg_count`, which tells us the *number* of eggs in stock, rather than simply *whether* there are eggs or not. If that number is 0, there are no eggs, if it's 1 or more, then there are eggs.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, we need a way to **compare** values (in this case an integer number of eggs) to evaluate to `True` or `False`. This is where the Python [comparison operators](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_basic_operators.htm) come in. We covered these in the Week 2 lecture. \n",
    "\n",
    "Last week, we looked at arithmetic (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `**`) and assignment (`=`, `+=`) operators. Arithmetic operators take what is on the left and perform a mathematical operation with the value on the right (e.g., `left plus right`, or `left divided by right`, or `left to the power of right`), whilst assignment operators take the value on the right and assign it to the variable on the left (or, in the case of `+=`, take the value of the variable on the left, add the value of the right hand side to it, and now make the variable on the left equal to the new value). \n",
    "\n",
    "Comparison operators are like arithmetic operators, in that they take the value on the left, and compare it to the value on the right, and then, depending on the result of the comparison, return `True` or `False`. We can either assign the boolean value to a variable, or, more commonly, just pass the condition to `if`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Probably the simplest of all these operators to understand is `==`, the **equality** operator. Note the double equals signs: this is intentional, as it means Python can understand the different between **assignment** and **equality** (this is an important point, one that can even [catch out very stable geniuses](http://mashable.com/2017/12/28/trump-website-obama-insult/#58TNdaEWHOqc)).\n",
